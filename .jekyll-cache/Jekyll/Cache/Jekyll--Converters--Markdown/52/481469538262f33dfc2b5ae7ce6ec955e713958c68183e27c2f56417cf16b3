        Hello world, I am building my first blog for science and technical topics called Not Very Humerus (NVH). I’ll be adding periodically to this collection and focusing on the technical side of my journey for a bit. I’ll try to proceed chronologically with some retrospectives at the beginning of the blog to focus on my experiences in University.

        Later on I’ll try to mix it up between computer/coding topics (most of my day-to-day) and scientific topics.
