    <h4>Welcome!</h4>
    <p>
        Welcome to the new website, Iâ€™ve recently merged my blog Not Very Humerus with my <a href="http://matthewralston.github.io/">static homepage</a>. The point of this blog post is to introduce the reader to my experience theming with Jekyll and specifically the Bulma clean theme.
    </p>
    <p>
        The best part of re-theming was the essential plug-and-play experience of copying my blogâ€™s <code class="code-pink">_post</code> directory into the Jekyll theme and watching the site automatically populate with my blogâ€™s content.
    </p>
    <p>
        The biggest challenge was wrestling with the siteâ€™s <code class="code-pink">site.baseurl</code> and <code class="code-pink">site.url</code> in generating working links throughout. Iâ€™m not sure if that was a bug that was truly mine, but it seemed like the raw theme didnâ€™t quite have the same problems. The problem started when I was changing the site.url to my localhost and eliminating <code class="code-pink">site.baseurl</code> in anticipation of the deployment to my primary Github static page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Aside from fixing some broken links in the blogâ€™s pagination, the purpose of exploring the possibilities by resetting <code class="code-pink">site.baseurl</code> was to simply get my meme popovers working again! After making the necessary adjustments, all of the memes display correctly on the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        The short term goal for the website is to simplify the sites maintenance and deployment needs. To this end, I was looking at 2 or 3 themes for the site redesign, with bulma-clean and prologue being the two forerunners. At the time, I liked the idea of the prologue themeâ€™s contact form using formspree.io but I couldnâ€™t ignore the flexibility in templating offered by bulma-clean. After copying the contact form, I elected to go for the older template instead of the very responsive HTML5 design in prologue.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the long term, Iâ€™d like to add a few applications and perhaps a more permanent solution to the contact page when I deploy the website to a dedicated server. But until that time, Iâ€™m very happy with the appearance and functionality of the site and its sections.
