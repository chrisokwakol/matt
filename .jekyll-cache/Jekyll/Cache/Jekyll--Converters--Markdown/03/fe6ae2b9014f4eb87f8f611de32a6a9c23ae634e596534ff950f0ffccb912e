    <h4>Review notes</h4>
    <p>
        These are some notes I jotted down while reading a study from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/26qk74/dads_who_do_household_chores_more_likely_to_have/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">Psychological Science</a> linked by /r/science Reddit at 2.3k updoots. This article had a somewhat clearer design and premise than a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dlz9j2/cohabitating_men_and_women_have_different_views/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share">more popular post</a> (8.8k currently) this morning in the same subreddit. <a href="https://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~abaron/downloads/Croft_Schmader_Block_Baron_PsySci2014.pdf">PDF to the former article</a> and the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-018-0998-1">Springer link to the latter</a>. I am reviewing the article to talk with a new acquaintance on the phone about feminism and gender equality.

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>
        Domestic unpaid labor blocks womens career advancement and personal achievement. Wives report doing 2x as much housework and childcare, even when both parents work full time, a phenomenon known as the â€˜Second Shift,â€™ referring to working a second unpaid shift. Because parents are early role models for their daughters, the influence of perceived gender roles can be very profound. Motherâ€™s employment has been shown to be predictive of their childrenâ€™s attitudes and aspirations. Moreover, if daughters perceive inequality in their home, a more direct and observable environment, it has an effect (unreferenced). The effect of a fatherâ€™s contributions has an even less studied effect on children or daughterâ€™s aspirations.

    <p>
        Interestingly, parentsâ€™ self-reported beliefs about gender roles are weakly predictive of childrenâ€™s gender-role and aspirations. I would hypothesize that parentsâ€™ reported beliefs may not reflect the actual imbalance or submissive and dominant behaviors that are expressing in the view of their children.
