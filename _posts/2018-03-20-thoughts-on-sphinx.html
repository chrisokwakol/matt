    <p>
        I’ve been exploring the Python documentation system for ReadTheDocs with Sphinx. It could be that I’m dense, but the <code class="code-pink">sphinx-quickstart</code> command seems horribly divorced from most of the automagic documentation goals of the Sphinx project. After following several guides1, 2 I noticed that only an index.rst had been created in the <code class="code-pink">_sources</code> directory. Brandon’s guide suggests that adding your module to either your PYTHONPATH or to your conf.py before <code class="code-pink">make html</code> would lead to autodoc recognizing your package. I wasn’t able to get this to work on OSX Sierra using a virtualenv. After looking through more tutorials, I encountered some suggestions for the <code class="code-pink">sphinx-apidoc</code> command, without actual invocation details.
    </p>
    <p>
        So it seems that to generate the documentation for a new module, you must run <code class="code-pink">sphinx-apidoc</code> to generate the module’s <code class="code-pink">.rst</code> file, and then run <code class="code-pink">make html</code> to generate the html. It’s remarkably easy when you figure it out, but kind of poorly documented considering the docs come from Sphinx and RTD directly.
    </p>
    <p>
        I suppose I assumed that <code class="code-pink">sphinx-quickstart</code> would have an option to specify existing module/lib directories and automatically bootstrap a Python package/project to make it a simpler experience. I highly recommend sphinx-mode.el for Emacs users, to automatically generate Sphinx-format docstrings and capture most of the function signature.
